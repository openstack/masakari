====================================
Welcome to Masakari's documentation!
====================================

Masakari is an OpenStack project designed to ensure high availability of
instances and compute processes running on hosts.

This documentation is intended to help explain the current scope of the
Masakari project and  the architectural decisions made to support this scope.
The documentation will include the future architectural roadmap and  the
current development process and policies.

Masakari API References
=======================

The `Masakari API <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/instance-ha/>`_ is
extensive. We provide a concept guide which gives some of the high level
details, as well as a more detailed API reference.
