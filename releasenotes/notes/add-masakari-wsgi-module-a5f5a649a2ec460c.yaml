    A new module, ``masakari.wsgi``, has been added as a place to gather WSGI
    ``application`` objects. This is intended to ease deployment by providing
    a consistent location for these objects. For example, if using uWSGI then
    instead of:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [uwsgi]
        wsgi-file = /bin/masakari-wsgi

    You can now use:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [uwsgi]
        module = masakari.wsgi.api:application

    This also simplifies deployment with other WSGI servers that expect module
    paths such as gunicorn.
